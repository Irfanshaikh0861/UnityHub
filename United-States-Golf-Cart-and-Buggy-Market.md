Each of these segments serves distinct needs and preferences, with varying growth prospects and consumer behavior. The residential application has seen increased interest due to the expanding trend of gated communities, retirement communities, and upscale housing estates where golf carts are used as an essential mode of transport for short trips within the property. Residential customers prioritize convenience, sustainability, and personalization in their golf cart choices, often opting for customized carts that reflect their style and preferences. Additionally, the rise in eco-conscious consumer behavior is pushing more buyers to select electric models, which are quieter and more environmentally friendly compared to traditional gasoline-powered carts.
